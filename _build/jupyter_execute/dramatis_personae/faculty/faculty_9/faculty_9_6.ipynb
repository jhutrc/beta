    "The Scenario Vector defines specific values for a given scenario. For instance, this can represent a 60-year-old black individual with certain medical conditions. Note that the first six positions in the vector are for the subgroups of race, and the last six are for the confounding variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "This series of steps takes the reader through the process of estimating the risk score and the associated 10-year mortality for a given scenario. It uses a semi-parametric model to create the underlying hazard function and uses specific scenario vectors to estimate the individualized risk for different populations or conditions.\n",

    "**Comment About Base-Case:**\n",
    "  > Interpretation would be more intuitive if centering were used. Without centering, the base-case is for a specific reference group (e.g., Mexican, 0 years old, non-diabetic, BMI=0, etc.) which is not very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "To adapt this portion of the code for another project or scenario, the analyst would need to redefine the scenario vector (`SV`) with the appropriate values for the new context. They would also need to ensure that the model's coefficients and variance-covariance matrix are correctly extracted, and that the calculations are aligned with the new scenario's specifications."
