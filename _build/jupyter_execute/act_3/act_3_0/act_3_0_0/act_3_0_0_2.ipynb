    "In the previous chapter, we discussed how version control using Git can be a superhero sidekick for managing your documents, allowing you to keep track of changes and maintain a clear history of your work. But did you know that version control has its origins in the world of code development?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Evolution of Version Control for Code\n",
    "Before Git, developers faced similar challenges to those encountered with multiple manuscript versions. They would create multiple files like \"table1_jhu_v1.ado,\" \"table1_jhu_v2.ado,\" or even \"table1_jhu_final.ado\" as they iteratively improved their code to generate Table 1, a crucial component in medical and epidemiological research (see below for an in-house example).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.3 The Power of Version Control in Code\n",
    "Just like in our manuscript example, code development also required a better way to manage versions and collaborate efficiently. And that's where version control systems came to the rescue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.4 Git: The Hero of Code Version Control\n",
    "Version control in the context of code serves the same fundamental purpose as it does for documents. However, instead of managing manuscripts' evolution, it tracks the evolution of code files like \"table1_jhu.ado.\" Just like snapshots in time, it records every change made to the codebase, allowing developers to review the history and understand how the code has progressed. An example in Stata of how things are currently done is shown in the code version 3.01 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.5 The Rise of Git\n",
    "Git, which we've been discussing in the manuscript context, is one such version control system designed primarily for code. Although we previously talked about manuscripts, the principles of version control apply equally to code files like \"table1_jhu.ado.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.6 Collaboration and Code Management with Git\n",
    "Git was initially created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel, but its adoption quickly spread among developers due to its efficiency, flexibility, and powerful features. It revolutionized how code projects were managed, enabling seamless collaboration between individuals and teams across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.7 Branching and Beyond\n",
    "Instead of passing files back and forth or creating countless copies, developers could now work together on the same codebase, creating branches to experiment with new ideas while preserving the main code's integrity, such as \"table1_jhu_development\" or \"table1_jhu_feature_branch.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.8 Version Control Platforms\n",
    "As version control became an integral part of the software development process, it also led to the rise of platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. These platforms provide a centralized and accessible location to host Git repositories, making it easier for developers to share their code and collaborate with others on projects like \"table1_jhu.ado.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.9 The Versatility of Git\n",
    "Today, Git has become the industry standard for version control, transforming how developers approach code development and fostering a vibrant and collaborative open-source community. Its adoption extends far beyond software development, as it has proven to be an invaluable tool for managing any project involving files and collaboration, including projects like \"table1_jhu.ado\" in medical and epidemiological research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.10 Streamlining Workflows\n",
    "So, whether you're working on a manuscript or developing code like \"table1_jhu.ado,\" version control systems like Git have become indispensable tools for modern collaborative workflows. By embracing version control principles, you can streamline your work, avoid confusion, and focus on what truly matters – delivering high-quality research and impactful contributions to your field. Happy version controlling! 🚀👩‍💻\n",
