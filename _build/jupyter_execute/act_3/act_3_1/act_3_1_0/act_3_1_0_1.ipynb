    "**Why automate?**\n",
    "- Make your life easier\n",
    "- Reproducibility\n",
    "- Efficiency\n",
    "- Collaboration\n",
    "- Scalability\n",

    "**Early steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter**\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to automate your data analysis. They allow you to combine code, text, and images in a single document (as is done throughout this Fena platform). This makes it easy to share your work with others and to reproduce your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow for automating your data analysis is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Jupyter Notebook using any of the following methods:\n",
    "   - Google Colab (unbelievably easy to use)\n",
    "   - Jupyter lab\n",
    "   - VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write code in the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "   - Jupyter lab and VS Code have a built-in code editor allowing you to write code in Python, R, Julia, and other languages\n",
    "   - We've developed a workflow that hacks this code editor to allow you to write code in any language you want e.g. Stata\n",
    "   - Sign up for our [advanced course](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/course/39118) to learn more about this workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the code in the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Save the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Share the Jupyter Notebook with others\n",
    "   - Beginners: upload it to Google Colab and sharing a link to the Colab notebook\n",
    "   - Intermediate: upload it to Jupyter lab and sharing a link to the Jupyter lab notebook\n",
    "   - Advanced: push it to GitHub pages and share a link to your book (as we've done with this Fena platform)\n",
    "\n",
