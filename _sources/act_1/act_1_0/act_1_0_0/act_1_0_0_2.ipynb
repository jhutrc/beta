    "# 2. Error  \n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Error in clinical research refers to the inaccuracies that may occur at any stage of the research process. These inaccuracies can distort the study's findings, leading to misleading conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Error\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Error\n",
    "Random errors are unpredictable fluctuations that can affect the study's measurements. These can be minimized but not entirely eliminated through proper design and statistical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systematic Error\n",
    "Systematic errors, or biases, occur when there's a consistent deviation from the truth in one direction. These can result from flaws in the study design or data collection process and may lead to false conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitigating Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing and addressing potential errors is essential. Regular monitoring, quality control checks, and using validated tools can reduce the likelihood of errors creeping into the study. Statistical techniques can further help in identifying and correcting biases.\n"
