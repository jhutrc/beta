    "Imagine you're about to board an airplane. You see the pilot meticulously checking the aircraft, adhering to a pre-flight checklist, ensuring every dial is accurate, every bolt is tight, and every engine is roaring at its best. That, in essence, is what rigor is in medical research—a set of checks and balances that makes sure the science we trust is as dependable as the planes we fly. Let's buckle up and explore why rigor is the unsung hero that underpins every medical breakthrough.\n",

    "  <Summary>Informed Decisions</Summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Image Explained**: Imagine a group of patients with bladder cancer. For each patient, there's a decision to make - are they suitable for a specific treatment called cisplatin? It's crucial because this treatment, while potentially beneficial, can also have adverse outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two tools, or methods, to help make this decision: CKD-EPI 2021 (a newer, race-free equation) and CKD-EPI 2009. These methods give us \"odds\", essentially the chances, of a patient being eligible for the treatment (Cisplatin+) or not (Cisplatin-). But there's more: these odds also hint at the likelihood of a patient facing adverse outcomes if they receive the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you might wonder, which method do we trust? To figure that out, we compare the odds given by both methods. This comparison, known as the 'odds ratio', is our compass. It shows us how the odds from one method stack up against the other. And because in medicine we always deal with uncertainties, we also present a range (the 95% CI) to show where the true odds ratio likely lies. Think of it as the margin of error in our compass, helping us navigate the decision-making journey more confidently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the image serves as a visual guide, simplifying complex decisions and potential outcomes into understandable terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being transparent in how we reached our results is as crucial as a surgeon discussing outcomes with a patient's family. It builds trust and allows others to understand, replicate, and expand on our work.\n",

    "**The Forensics of the Clinical Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical researchers are akin to [detectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson) arriving at a crime scene. To solve the case—or in our context, to answer the research question—they need a forensic-level understanding of the clinical problem. This goes beyond just what or who; it delves into how, why, and what if. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Architect and the Blueprint**\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the research design is like constructing a skyscraper. It starts with a blueprint that lays out what the study aims to achieve and how it plans to get there, a carefully orchestrated composition of methods, participants, and metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Compass and the Navigator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis in medical research is like navigating through a dense jungle; a good compass is essential for survival. Here, the compass is our statistical methodology, helping us sift through a thicket of numbers to find our way to clear, actionable insights.\n",

    "  <Summary>The Nitty-Gritty: Analytic Design</Summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Eligibility and the Art of Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine casting for a film. Not just any actor fits every role; likewise, not just any patient fits every study. The casting decisions you make are critical to the story you'll ultimately tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Propensity for Outcomes: Leveling the Playing Field\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever balanced a seesaw, you know it's all about equal weight on both sides. In clinical studies, this balance is known as propensity for outcomes between study and control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Surrogate Markers of Outcomes: Continuous Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in a surrogate marker over time may be a good indicator of the ultimate outcome of interest. But there are a few things to keep in mind when using continuous measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "<Details>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <Summary>Variance in measures as explanation, not as bias</Summary>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  + **Calibration**: Ensuring the continuous measure serves as a valid surrogate for the ultimate outcome is not a one-off process. New technologies will keep emerging and require recalibration of the measure to ensure it remains a valid surrogate.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  + **Longitudinal**: Repeated measures of the same individuals over time can be powerful but require specialized statistical models like mixed-effects models or generalized estimating equations to account for within-subject correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + **Hierarchical**: If data are clustered by some phenotype or other categorization (like hospital or geographic location), you'll need to use hierarchical or multilevel models to account for this clustering. This is particularly important for avoiding Type I errors (false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "</Details>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Time-to-event data: Survival Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of a disease might be like a sprint, a marathon, or something in-between. Everyone who reaches the finish line has an outcome. This is known as an event (often an ICD code or death). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Interaction: The Plot Twists of Medical Research\n",
    "\n",
    "In a novel, plot twists keep us hooked. Similarly, interaction effects in a study can reveal unexpected but critical information that keeps researchers on their toes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Multiple Comparisons: Juggling with Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine juggling. The more balls in the air, the higher the chance of a mistake. Likewise, conducting multiple comparisons in a study requires a higher level of skill to prevent errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Missing Data: The Ghosts in Our Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of data as the cast of a play. If key characters go missing, the story falls apart. The same goes for our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Visualization: A Snapshot Worth a Thousand Data Points\n",
    "\n",
    "A compelling visual can go viral in today's digital age. Similarly, a well-crafted visualization in a study can rapidly communicate complex data to a wide audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Generalizability: From Local Stage to Global Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever watched a local artist become a global superstar? That’s what generalizability is all about in research—making sure your findings are ready for the big league.\n",
    "\n",
    "</Details>\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "So there you have it—rigor may be the unsung hero of medical research, but it's what turns average science into life-saving breakthroughs. Much like a pilot’s checklist ensures a safe flight, rigor ensures that medical research is dependable, ethical, and impactful. So, the next time you hear about a new revolutionary treatment or vaccine, remember that rigor was its co-pilot, steering it safely from question to answer, from the lab bench to your medicine cabinet.\n",
