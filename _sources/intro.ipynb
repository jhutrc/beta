    "In the modern era of medical research, collaboration, transparency, and open access to knowledge are paramount. Embracing the \"we are all in the same boat\" philosophy, our community, ranging from high school students to faculty, staff, analysts, and collaborators, has adopted Fena, an innovative static site generator. This Luganda term, idiomatic for our collective engagement, epitomizes our unified approach to challenges like truth, rigor, error, and sloppiness, while also acknowledging the daily grind of academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fena is our platform to sail in the same boat across various projects involving git, code, manuscripts, and the utilization of skills like Python, AI tools (ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot), R, Stata, and more. It equips us to navigate the complex terrains of numeracy, such as point and interval estimates, and literacy, in alignment with the open-science movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through self-publication, web apps with individualized risk scores for patients, peer-reviewed publications, and grant applications, Fena fosters a sense of shared responsibility and ambition. It's not just a tool but a symbol of our unified pursuit of medical progress, emphasizing that whether in skill development, challenging tasks, or innovative projects, we are all steering in the same direction. This unique embrace of Fena promises to revolutionize the way we share research, break down barriers to access, and accelerate the pace of medical advancements in a world where, indeed, we are all in the same boat.\n",
