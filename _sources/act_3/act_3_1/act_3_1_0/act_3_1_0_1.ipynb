    "[Bash](./act_3_1_0_2.ipynb), the Bourne Again SHell, is a cornerstone of computing mastery. Beyond command execution, Bash exemplifies streamlined operations and a profound understanding. It offers **controlled automation**. While interactve graphical user interfaces (GUIs) provide a superficial interaction, Bash delves deeper, facilitating a richer conversation with the system. Locate the terminal on your computer (search for 'Terminal' in MacOS or 'Command Prompt' in Windows). Then, type `ls -l` to list the files in your current directory. You've just executed your first Bash command.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initiate a Jupyter Notebook**: Using Google Colab, Jupyter Lab, or VS Code.\n",
    "2. **Develop Code**: Use the built-in code editor in Jupyter Lab or VS Code. Our unique workflow even allows code writing in non-traditional Jupyter languages like Stata.\n",
    "3. **Execute the Code**.\n",
    "4. **Save the Notebook**.\n",
    "5. **Share the Notebook**: Ranging from basic sharing via Google Colab to advanced methods like pushing to GitHub pages.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Libraries Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: Use `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Visualization**: `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` are renowned for plotting and graphing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: `Scikit-learn` simplifies machine learning model creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical Modeling**: Utilize `Statsmodels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bayesian Modeling**: Turn to `PyMC3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep Learning**: Opt for `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, or `PyTorch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web Scraping**: `Scrapy`, `Beautiful Soup`, `Selenium`, and `Requests` are your go-to libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing**: Use `NLTK`, `SpaCy`, or `Gensim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network Analysis**: Explore networks with `NetworkX`, `PyGraphviz`, or `PyTorch Geometric`.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Familiarize yourself with basic Unix commands.\n",
    "2. [Construct a bash script](./act_3_1_0_2.ipynb) for executing code in Python, R, Stata, etc.\n",
