    "\n",
    "**Intro: Why Stata is the Smartphone of Data Analysis Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's drop the formalities. We all love our smartphones, right? Imagine having all your essential apps‚Äîlike Instagram, Snapchat, and Spotify‚Äîpre-installed the moment you unwrap your phone. No more scrolling through app stores, dealing with downloads, or fumbling with settings. That's what Stata is to the data analysis world. It's the 'out-of-the-box,' fully-loaded smartphone, and here at Johns Hopkins, we're turning every student into a high-tier app developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Makes Stata So Fresh?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**No Package Drama** üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "You know the drill with Python and R: before you can even get started, you're already busy hunting down packages, installing them, and praying everything's compatible. It's like buying a PS5 but still needing to download every game and add-on manually. With Stata, everything you traditionally need for data management and advanced statistics‚Äîespecially if you're into epidemiology or clinical research‚Äîis already installed! It's like getting a PS5 with all the top-tier games pre-loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero to Hero in 9 Months** üöÄ   \n",
    "\n",
    "Got no time to master the complexities of Python or R, with their endless installations and package management? We totally get it. Whether you're at Hopkins pursuing a dual MD-MPH, focusing on a GTPCI Ph.D., or a grad student in another field, you've got big responsibilities. You have research to conduct, papers to write, and lives to save‚Äîwhether it's millions at a time in public health or just one at a time in clinical practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where Stata comes in, and so do we.\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that you're not just here to play with code. You're on a mission to make a difference. So in just 8 weeks, we'll empower you with the data analysis skills you need to excel in your respective fields‚Äîno coding headaches involved. With Stata, you can focus on what truly matters: advancing science, impacting policy, and, yes, saving lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be Your Own Developer** üë®‚Äçüíª\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever wanted to customize your favorite game or app? In Stata, not only do you get a fully-loaded arsenal of statistical tools, but you also get the freedom to create your custom programs. It's like turning your PS5 into a development studio, where you're the head developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Like You Text** üì±\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding in Stata is like texting with syntax highlighting, thanks to VS Code's Stata extensions. No more wall-of-text codes. Stata with VS Code turns each line of code into an Instagrammable moment, complete with all the aesthetic and #nofilter vibes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run Your Code, Not a Marathon** üèÉ\n",
    "\n",

    "**Conclusion: Why Stata is the BFF You Never Knew You Needed** ü§ó\n",
    "\n",
    "So, whether you're just starting your journey or you're already down the data science rabbit hole, Stata has your back. It‚Äôs the unsung hero in a world where everyone's caught up in the Python vs. R battle. It's reliable, it's chic, and it's all about making your life easier.\n",

    "Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides syntax highlighting based on file extensions and language modes. If you want to get nice colors (syntax highlighting) for your Stata `.do` files in VS Code, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install a Stata Extension for VS Code**: \n",
    "    - Open VS Code.\n",
    "    - Go to Extensions (you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X` on PC or `Command+Shift+X` on Mac).\n",
    "    - Search for `Stata`.\n",
    "    - You should see a few extensions that provide Stata language support. One popular choice is \"Stata Enhanced\". Install it (or another that you prefer).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Save or Rename Your File**: \n",
    "    - If you are creating a new Stata file, simply save it with the `.do` extension. For existing files that don't have this extension, you can rename them to include `.do`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Select the Right Language Mode**: \n",
    "    - Sometimes, VS Code might not automatically recognize the correct language mode for your file. If that's the case, you can manually set it.\n",
    "    - In the bottom right corner of the VS Code window, you'll see a language label (like \"Plain Text\" or something else). Click on it.\n",
    "    - A search bar will appear at the top. Type `Stata` and select it from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing the above, your Stata `.do` file should now have proper syntax highlighting in VS Code. Remember, the effectiveness of the syntax highlighting depends on the quality of the Stata extension you've chosen. Some extensions may provide more detailed and accurate highlighting than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Details>\n",
    "\n",
    "Stata syntax highlighting in Visual Studio Code, built from the ground up.\n",
    "Also available for Atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "stata Code snippet from Gtools, a faster implementation of Stata's collapse and egen using C plugins. Shown with the Material theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features\n",
    "This package highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "System commands, functions, and function arguments\n",
    "Macros, both global and local\n",
    "Accurately colors nested macros and escaped macros in strings when you want the inner macro to evaluate at runtime\n",
    "Colors macro extended functions inside `: ... ' as well as after local lname:\n",
    "Comments, more accurately than Stata's Do-file Editor.\n",
    "Regular expressions\n",
    "Colors both the limited syntax provided through the regexr() and regexm() functions, as well as the vastly expanded regex syntax provided in Stata 14 and 15 through the ustrregexm(), ustrregexrf(), and ustrregexra() functions.\n",
    "Dynamic Markdown and LaTeX documents. Instructions below.\n",
    "Other nice features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Works with unicode identifiers. Use unicode anywhere it's legal Stata syntax.\n",
    "Alerts you if your variable name is illegal, i.e. if your variable name is more than 32 chars, starts with a number, or is a reserved name.\n",
    "Alerts you if you have any text other than } on a line ending a foreach/forvalues/if/else command\n",
    "Local macro back tick autocompletion. When you write a `, Visual Studio Code automatically fills in a ' after your cursor\n",
    "Makes it easy to spot incorrect nesting of compound quotes\n",
    "Support for programming ligatures for all valid Stata syntax for fonts that support them, like the Fira Code font.\n",
    "Highlights SQL queries used in the odbc command. (The language-sql base package must be active.)\n",
    "Note\n",
    "Some themes may not color all parts of the syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "Running Code\n",
    "This package doesn't have the capabilities to run your code in Stata. If you're using Linux, you can use my scripts with the Autokey automation utility to quickly run selections of your files in a graphical session of Stata.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also be interested in trying to port Atom's stata-exec package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stata 15 brought new features for working with dynamic documents. The dyndoc command lets you write in Markdown and converts your file and code to HTML for viewing in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also added the dyntext command, which fills in Stata output for any text file, without touching the text itself. This lets you then use third-party document generators like Pandoc and LaTeX to generate documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package now provides syntax highlighting for Stata code written inside Stata's dynamic tags for Markdown and LaTeX documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, this package's Markdown and LaTeX syntax highlighting will be applied for files ending in .domd and .dotex respectively. The Markdown All in One and LaTeX Workshop packages must be installed for the highlighting to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you name your file with a different extension, you can manually set the highlighting by clicking on the \"Plain Text\" button on the bottom right of the screen (or by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+L) and then selecting Stata Dyndoc (Markdown) or Stata Dyndoc (LaTeX) from the drop-down menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "An example of the PDF output of using dyntext and Pandoc is in the examples folder: dyntext.pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "That file was created by running\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "dyntext dyntext.domd, saving(dyntext.md) replace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "from inside Stata 15, and then with\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pandoc dyntext.md -o dyntext.pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
