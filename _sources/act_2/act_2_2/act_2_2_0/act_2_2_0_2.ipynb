    "In today's modern data ecosystem, the power lies not just in mastering a single tool but in orchestrating a symphony with various instruments. Leveraging Google Colab's environment, one can seamlessly use Python, Stata, and R, all within a single .ipynb notebook. And with GitHub providing access to a Linux terminal via Virtual Studio Code, the barriers between languages blur, creating an unparalleled playground for data enthusiasts.\n",
