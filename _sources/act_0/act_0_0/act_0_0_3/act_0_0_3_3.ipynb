    "1. **Introduction**:\n",
    "   - [Project](https://github.com/jhurepos/projectalpha/blob/main/seasons_projectalpha_0/seasons.docx) led by Andrew, studying seasonality of kidney donation in the U.S.\n",
    "   - Examining implications and reversal of donor decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Background**:\n",
    "   - Observed decline in kidney donors.\n",
    "   - No identified factors [explaining/controling](./../../../act_1/act_1_0/act_1_0_0/act_1_0_0_1.ipynb) the decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Objectives**:\n",
    "   - Investigate seasonality (hierarchical data) and factors (mixed effects) contributing to it in kidney donation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Methodology**:\n",
    "   - [Revamp entire analysis](./act_0_0_3_4.ipynb) using `group-level and individual-level predictors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Results**:\n",
    "   - Identification of summer surge in donations from 1987-2023. [See](./act_0_0_3_4.ipynb) back-of-the-envelope calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Discussion**:\n",
    "   - Emphasizing significance of seasonal variation and potential implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Current Status**:\n",
    "   - Andrew made his first direct commit on 8/31, focusing on the figures.\n",
    "   - He did not update using immediately preceding version, so the commit history is not accurate.\n",
    "   - Problem might have come from Abi's misleading commit message on 8/30 \"This is just for demo purposes\".\n",
    "   - The only demo was in the title but substantive edits were made to the intro, methods, results, and discussion\n",
    "   - **Let's discuss this in our next meeting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Next Steps**:\n",
    "   - Wait for comments from Fawaz before we schedule the next meeting. \n",
    "   - Encourage Fawaz to make direct commits to the manuscript!!\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Remark**:\n",
    "   - Andrew will have to update his R script to accomodate issues raised in the [revamped analysis](./act_0_0_3_4.ipynb).\n",
    "   - [Chapter 2](./../../../act_1/act_1_0/act_1_0_0/act_1_0_0_1.ipynb) of this platform will be helpful in understanding the new approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Version history**:\n",
    "   - Please don't be afraid of making extensive comments to a version or even a mistake.\n",
    "   - We can always revert to a previous version if needed :)\n",

    "\n",
    "Dear Andrew and Abi,\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this message finds you well. First, let me congratulate Andrew on the significant improvements made to the manuscript so far. The revisions have brought it a long way. However, I believe we should further refine the manuscript by adjusting some figures and emphasizing our key findings more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; position: relative; top: 0.0em;\">Background and Take-Home Message:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** The decline in living kidney donors over the past two decades has been notably due to a decrease in biologically related donors. Our study aims to identify modifiable factors to reverse this trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Our findings indicate that biologically related donors from lower and middle income tiers, based on Zip-code, show an increase in donations during the summer. We advocate for targeted programs that can help these groups expand donations in the summer while also overcoming barriers in other seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; position: relative; top: 0.0em;\">General Points:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please update the study time window to 1990-2019 in all figures, tables, and texts.\n",
    "- Figure 2 is particularly compelling as it highlights the summer peak in donations across the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; position: relative; top: 0.0em;\">Minor Points:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Figure 1:** Limit the time window to 1990-2019.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Figure 2:** \n",
    "    - Thin the lines slightly for better readability.\n",
    "    - Adjust Y-axis label to \"U.S. Monthly Living Kidney Donation\" (and clarify in a footnote that this reflects the median).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Figure 3:**\n",
    "    - For the legend, use \"lowest, middle, highest tertile\" instead of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.\n",
    "    - Y-axis label should read \"Donation Incidence Rate Ratio.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; position: relative; top: 0.0em;\">Major Points:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Figure 2 Revisions:**\n",
    "    - Keep the Y-axis the same.\n",
    "    - Adjust the X-axis to span from 1990 to 2019.\n",
    "    - Change the trend category from \"Era\" to \"Season.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Figure 3 Revisions:**\n",
    "    - Keep the Y-axis the same.\n",
    "    - Adjust the X-axis to reflect seasons.\n",
    "    - Stratify this revised Figure 3 by race/ethnicity:\n",
    "        - Among White\n",
    "        - Among Black\n",
    "        - Among Asian\n",
    "        - Among Hispanic\n",
    "        - Exclude other races from this figure for consistency with previous studies but mention them in Table 1 under \"Others.\"\n",

    "I am available to meet for further discussions this coming week, as needed. For urgent matters, please feel free to text me at 720-401-9364.\n",
