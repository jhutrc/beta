    "Univariable Survival Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Individualized Risk Prediction**: The code calculates individualized risk predictions using survival analysis, specifically the Cox proportional hazards model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semi-Parametric Approach**: The Cox model is considered a semi-parametric model. This is because it makes no assumptions about the form of the baseline hazard function (hence \"non-parametric\" for the baseline hazard) but does assume a parametric form for the effect of predictors. In mathematical terms, the hazard function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $h(t | X) = h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $h_0(t)$  is the baseline hazard function, $\\beta$ is the vector of coefficients, and $X$ is the vector of covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subgroups Considered**: The survival analysis is performed for specific subgroups, identified by the variable [ridreth3](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/DEMO_G.htm#RIDRETH3). These include Mexican, Hispanic, White, Black, Asian, and Other.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Matrices Explanation**:\n",
    "   - `b`: Contains the coefficients $\\beta$ of the model.\n",
    "   - `V`: Contains the variance-covariance matrix, used for calculating standard errors.\n",
    "   - `SV`: A scenario vector, used to calculate the risk score for a specific scenario.\n",
    "   - `risk_score`: The risk score calculated as $\\text{SV} \\times \\beta$.\n",
    "   - `var_prediction`: Variance of the risk score prediction.\n",
    "   - `se_prediction`: Standard error of the risk score prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Graphs**:\n",
    "   - The first graph illustrates the survival rates for different subgroups.\n",
    "   - The second graph depicts survival rates for a specific scenario defined in the matrix `SV`. For the mathematical details, look [here](faculty_9_5.ipynb).\n",

    "Final Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire code process takes a semi-parametric approach to calculate and visualize individualized risk predictions using survival analysis. Subgroup analysis is also performed based on the variable ridreth3, considering different ethnicities. Two different graphs illustrate the survival rates both generally and for a specific scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images depicting nonparametric and semiparametric mortality risk are also included in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the steps detailed above, the code achieves the goal of analyzing 10-year risk with potential adaptability to assess 30-year risk in the future. For more practice in a multivariable survival analysis setting, see [here](./act_0_0_7_7.ipynb)."
