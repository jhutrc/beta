    "1. Introduction:\n",
    "   Our collaborative [research project](https://github.com/jhutrc/beta/blob/main/seasons.docx) is led by andrew and aimed at investigating the seasonality of living kidney donation in the United States. We explore the potential implications of this seasonality and its role in reversing the concerning patterns of general decline in living kidney donors over nearly two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Background:\n",
    "   We discuss the observed patterns of decline in the annual number of living kidney donors in the United States, which vary based on the donor-recipient relationship. Then we highlight the absence of identified factors explaining and reversing these patterns thus far.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Objectives:\n",
    "   The specific objectives for this research project include examining the seasonality in living kidney donation and investigating potentially modifiable social, economic, and structural factors that may contribute to this seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Methodology:\n",
    "   Data are from the SRTR and span from 1987 to March 2023. We utilized Poisson regression analysis, stratified by both donor-recipient biological relationship and estimated household income tertiles, to quantify the observed trends. We also used a Fourier series to model the seasonal variation in living kidney donation rates. (suggested by the Github co-pilot AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Results:\n",
    "   Herein we present our key findings derived from the data analysis. Highlight the novel identification of a summer-only surge in living kidney donations, consistently observed across all decades from 1987 to March 2023, regardless of donor-recipient relationship and income tertiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Discussion:\n",
    "   Interpret the results within the context of our research objectives, emphasizing the significance of the observed seasonal variation in living kidney donation rates. Discuss the potential implications of these findings, particularly the influence of structural factors on donation patterns and the identification of possible targets for increasing donation rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Current Status:\n",
    "   Edit to Intro on 08/08/2023 as of 1:35PM and will use the following github commit statement: `please add with EndNote -- Motivated by the notion that social-structural barriers may impact living kidney donation (Purnell PMID PMID: 22732044, 2012)`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Doodle Poll:** \n",
    "  - Reschedule meeting with Fawaz/Abi/Andrew to discuss the paper.\n",
    "  - Suggest 3 dates and times for the meeting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Introduction:**\n",
    "  - Praise for the paper.\n",
    "  - An offer to meet via Zoom to discuss further.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedback and Comments:**\n",
    "  - **Table 1:**\n",
    "    - Positive feedback on its reflection of the main concept (seasonal donation in related and unrelated donors).\n",
    "    - *Minor Comment:* Suggested adjustment to the title.\n",
    "  - **Figure 1:**\n",
    "    - Positive feedback but with an indication that it needs modification.\n",
    "    - *Major Comment:* Suggestion to reproduce the figure and categorize it by related and unrelated.\n",
    "  - **Figures 3A and 3B:**\n",
    "    - Positive feedback.\n",
    "  - **Figure 2:**\n",
    "    - Indication that it is problematic, with a suggestion to move it to supplementary material.\n",
    "    - *Major Comments:*\n",
    "      - Suggestion to modify the study time window to be from 1990 to 2019.\n",
    "      - Explanation that this will create 3 equal decades and avoid COVID-19 impact.\n",
    "      - Interest in conducting a sensitivity analysis of Poisson inferences for specific time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ongoing Work:**\n",
    "  - Mention of ongoing efforts to polish the intro and discussion sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Closing Remarks:**\n",
    "  - Encouragement and the sentiment that \"Together we can make a difference.\"\n",
