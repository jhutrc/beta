    "Let's delve into the specific portion of the code that deals with the `risk score calculation` and the scenario vector (SV). I'll explain each part of this code snippet and highlight the specific example provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Matrices and Risk Score:**\n",
    "   ```stata\n",
    "   matrix define m = r(table)\n",
    "   matrix b = e(b)\n",
    "   matrix V = e(V)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   These lines define matrices based on the results of the previously fit Cox model. `m` stores the table of results, `b` stores the coefficients, and `V` stores the variance-covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scenario Vector (SV):**\n",
    "   ```stata\n",
    "   //SV: black, 40yo, diabetic, BMI=36, h/o smoking, SCr=1.8, HbA1c=7.1\n",
    "   matrix SV = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 60, 1, 36, 1, 1.5, 7.1)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Here, the SV is defined with specific values for an individual scenario. In this example, the scenario represents a 40-year-old black individual who is diabetic, has a BMI of 36, a history of smoking, a serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.8, and a Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculating the Risk Score:**\n",
    "   ```stata\n",
    "   matrix risk_score = SV * b'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line multiplies the scenario vector with the transpose of the coefficients to calculate the risk score.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Log Hazard Ratio:**\n",
    "   ```stata\n",
    "   //log HR for scenario vector above\n",
    "   matrix list risk_score \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This displays the log hazard ratio for the specified scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hazard Ratio for Scenario:**\n",
    "   ```stata\n",
    "   //HR for scenario described compared with \"base-case\"\n",
    "   di exp(risk_score[1,1])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This calculates the hazard ratio by taking the exponential of the log hazard ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Variance and Standard Error of Prediction:**\n",
    "   ```stata\n",
    "   matrix var_prediction = SV * V * SV'\n",
    "   matrix se_prediction = sqrt(var_prediction[1,1])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   These lines calculate the variance and standard error of the prediction for the scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Comment About Base-Case:**\n",
    "   The comment explains that the interpretation would be more intuitive if centering were used. Without centering, the base-case is for a specific reference group (e.g., Mexican, 0 years old, non-diabetic, BMI=0, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To adapt this portion of the code for another project or scenario, the analyst would need to redefine the scenario vector (`SV`) with the appropriate values for the new context. They would also need to ensure that the model's coefficients and variance-covariance matrix are correctly extracted, and that the calculations are aligned with the new scenario's specifications.\n",
