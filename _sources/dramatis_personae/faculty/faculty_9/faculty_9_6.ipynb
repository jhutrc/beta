    "This series of steps takes the reader through the process of estimating the risk score and the associated 10-year mortality for a given scenario.

    "  > Interpretation would be more intuitive if centering were used. Without centering, the base-case is for a specific reference group (e.g., Mexican, 0 years old, non-diabetic, BMI=0, etc.) which is not very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "To adapt this portion of the code for another project or scenario, the analyst would need to redefine the scenario vector (`SV`) with the appropriate values for the new context. They would also need to ensure that the model's coefficients and variance-covariance matrix are correctly extracted, and that the calculations are aligned with the new scenario's specifications."
