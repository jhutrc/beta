    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Individualized Risk Prediction**: The code calculates individualized risk predictions using survival analysis, specifically the Cox proportional hazards model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semi-Parametric Approach**: The Cox model is considered a semi-parametric model. This is because it makes no assumptions about the form of the baseline hazard function (hence \"non-parametric\" for the baseline hazard) but does assume a parametric form for the effect of predictors. In mathematical terms, the hazard function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $h(t | X) = h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $h_0(t)$  is the baseline hazard function, $\\beta$ is the vector of coefficients, and $X$ is the vector of covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subgroups Considered**: The survival analysis is performed for specific subgroups, identified by the variable [ridreth3](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/DEMO_G.htm#RIDRETH3). These include Mexican, Hispanic, White, Black, Asian, and Other.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Matrices Explanation**:\n",
    "   - `b`: Contains the coefficients $\\beta$ of the model.\n",
    "   - `V`: Contains the variance-covariance matrix, used for calculating standard errors.\n",
    "   - `SV`: A scenario vector, used to calculate the risk score for a specific scenario.\n",
    "   - `risk_score`: The risk score calculated as $\\text{SV} \\times \\beta$.\n",
    "   - `var_prediction`: Variance of the risk score prediction.\n",
    "   - `se_prediction`: Standard error of the risk score prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Graphs**:\n",
    "   - The first graph illustrates the survival rates for different subgroups.\n",
    "   - The second graph depicts survival rates for a specific scenario defined in the matrix `SV`. For the mathematical details, look [here](faculty_9_5.ipynb).\n",
